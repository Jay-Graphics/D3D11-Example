This is the same folder we will use when grading your exam.

Copy this folder to your project folder and access the included assets in the following way:

Textures:

LoadTextureFunction( "Assets/Textures/TextureYouWantToLoad.dds" )

Models: (If Applicable)

LoadModelFunction( "Assets/Models/ModelYouWantToLoad.obj" )

Other: (Shaders & Model Headers)

Any files that get compiled in directly such as shaders are source code and should NOT be in this folder.

Be sure to carefully follow the submission guidelines during turn-in.
Use this folder to make sure your submission builds & runs when unzipped.


Notes:

All assets found on OpenGameArt.org.
Models and associated Textures are either Community Commons or Public Domain.
